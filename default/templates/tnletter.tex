<<# This is the default tnletter / Teilnehmerbrief template. It is a placeholder template, which extends the basic
    tnletter (`tnletter.base.tex`) without overriding any of its contents, to allow rendering the default contents.
    To customize the tnletter, you should create a `tnletter.tex` in your custom template directory, to override this
    default template.

    Your custom `tnletter.tex` may either be written from scratch, without any dependency on the base template, or
    extend the base template and redefine some of its "blocks". The perferred way of customization is extending
    `tnletter.base.tex` and redefining the `content` block.
